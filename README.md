## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge, I reinforced my understanding of Flexbox for layout and semantic HTML for accessibility. Here's a snippet of the HTML code that I'm particularly proud of:

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
  <title>Frontend Mentor | QR code component</title>
```

And here's how I used Flexbox in the CSS:

```css
.container {
      display: flex;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
      min-height: 100vh;
      background-color: #D5E1EF;
      padding: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility and responsive design to ensure a great user experience across all devices.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) - This helped me understand the Flexbox layout system better.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - A detailed guide that was invaluable for this project.
